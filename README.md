# Servers System Simulator
This project is about simulating a distributed servers system. The idea behind this systems is to attend as many requests as quickly as possible with the available computational resources.


## What is considered **ONE** operation?
- Every rotation of **Hard Disc**. (rotating from 1 to 4 or any other number is an operation)
- Consuming an element from the **Processing Queue**.
- Pushing a request to the **Succesful Requests Queue**.
- Reorganize / Reordering the **RAM**.
- Executing a **Complete Request** (example, making everything neccesary to sum SUM, multiply in MUL, divide in DIV)
